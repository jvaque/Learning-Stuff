# Playing around with different prime sieve algorithms

Inspired by Dave Plummer prime sieve, and it's following [Primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes) repo that contains more implementations that I can currently comprehend in more languages than I know.

This is just an exercise to implement a few well established algorithms on my own and compare their relative performance.

**Q: Why?**

A: Why, not. Learning is fun after all!
