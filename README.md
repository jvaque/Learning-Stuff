# Learning-Stuff

This repo is to be the home of different things to play with to avoid having dozens of projects when learning new stuff.

Some things might be moved to unique repos if they would better fit standalone.

### Some stuff that was previously written and haven't thought of a good place to move to

- Get Node.js

- Get Simple React Snippets vs code extension

- Include in emmet settings the following

```
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascriptreact",
    "typescript": "typescriptreact"
}
```

- Create typescript react app with `npx create-react-app app-name --template typescript`
